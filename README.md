## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Allow users to input numbers (integer or float) by clicking on digit buttons or keyboard.
-Allow users to input a decimal point.
- Exponentiation (^) and logarithmic (log) functions.
- Trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, and tangent.
- Square root (√) function.
- Constant π (pi) for mathematical calculations.
- Conversion of expressions to binary.
- Offset arrow and reset.
- Percentage Calculation
- Graphing of mathematical expressions using Chart.js.
- Dark mode for improved visibility in low-light environments.

### Error Handling
- The project includes robust error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.
- Errors are detected during the evaluation of mathematical expressions, such as division by zero or incorrect evaluations of functions.

### Bootstrap Utilization
- The user interface design is enhanced through the use of Bootstrap.
Bootstrap provides responsive layout and stylized components for an attractive presentation and intuitive user experience.

### Example for Graph
- When a trigonometric function is entered with a specific value, for example `cos(3)`, the graph of the function is displayed.
- In this case, the `cos(x)` function is plotted, with the specified value `x = 3` highlighted in red on the graph.
- This allows the user to clearly visualize the point corresponding to the specified value on the graph.

## Usage

To use the calculator, simply click on the buttons provided to input numbers and perform operations. You can also use your keyboard for input. Pressing Enter will calculate the expression displayed on the screen. The "To Binary" button converts the expression to its binary equivalent. The "Mode" button toggles between displaying the graph of a mathematical expression and hiding it.

## How to Run

To run the calculator, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No additional installation or setup is required.
